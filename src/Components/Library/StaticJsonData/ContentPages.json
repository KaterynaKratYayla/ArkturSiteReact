A charming city with splendid architecture, ancient golden-domed cathedrals and numerous parks on both sides of the mighty Dnipro River, Kyiv is a tourist’s delight. During a city tour you will have the possibility to visit the famous Andriyivsky Uzviz Descent where numerous artists and craftsmen offer their works; the Golden Gate – the remains of a huge wall that was erected in the 10th century to protect the city, and the Parliament building situated in a beautiful park. The enormous territory of the city makes it hard at first to find one’s way through but luckily there are two helpful points – the Dnipro and the Metro. The river crosses the city in a north-south direction; the old town is situated on the high right bank, while new districts occupy the left bank. In the Old Kyiv (the Upper Town), known as the Mother of Rus cities, there are lots of ancient monuments that show the art of the builders and culture of the Ukrainian people. Although the city has changed its visage to a modern face, nothing can change the greatness the ancient monuments and the mighty Dnipro . Near the Upper Town and Podil (where ships are docked) is Pechersk, one of the oldest districts of the city. Its name is closely connected to Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Monastery (pechery means caves), the most significant Monastery of ancient old Kyiv Rus state and uptil now one of 6 shrines and places of worship of Orthodox Christianity – 6 Lavra monasteries , spread out throughout the world .",

Odesa is situated on terraced hills overlooking Odesa Bay, an inlet of the Black Sea that forms a natural harbor. It is a joyful city, full of humor, with its own dialect, local patriotism and some incongruities. Odesa was founded by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. Odesa abounds in sights, historical streets, fine art museums, charismatic hotels and restaurants. Odesa is the bright image of an outstanding Ukrainian city. Influenced by the humid southern sea climate and specific historical past, all the citizens of Odesa are distinguished by a bright appearance and outstanding character.     Odessa is one of the warmest region in Ukraine with an average daily high temperature of 16 degrees centigrade. The climate is much more unsettled than in central Europe and offers varied seasons with deep winters and warm summers. A beach holiday can also be enjoyed in the warmer season, but water temperatures will not reach much more than 22 °C. Due to the warmer temperatures the best time for traveling is from May to September. Nearly unattractive for tourists are the cold months from November to March",

        "Description" : "You should begin your journey around Lviv by walking through the streets of the Old City and visiting High Castle Hill – the highest spot of the city that gives an opportunity to see a great panorama of Lviv with its state-of-art architecture, that reflects almost all the trends of European art of the 13-20th centuries. We invite you to stroll along the alley of the quiet Stryisky Park and see Boims Chapel, which is truly unique in Eastern Europe as far as its architecture and fretwork are concerned. Drop by the Italian Courtyard and walk within the vivid Armenian and Jewish quarters. Lviv also called as “The Lion City” became a house of many religions. Today some of the city’s street names – for example Virmenska (Armenian) , Yevreyska (Jewish) and Serbska (Serbian) – still remind visitors that once ethnic communities of Ukrainians and Greeks, Germans and Serbs, Jews, Italians and Poles, Scots, Tatars, Hungarians and Saracens combined to create a Babylon of the medieval town of Lviv. Don’t miss Rynok Square located at the very heart of the city. The Square together with the City Hall make one of the best architectural ensembles in the city. The narrow cobbled streets around Rynok Square once housed the workshops of Lviv printers, chemists and numerous Lviv tradesmen. Cozy cafes, where Lviv’s literary and artistic Bohemia liked getting together, create particularly fascinating atmosphere in the Old City. Black coffee is an integral part of living Lviv-style. It is said that it was Prince Yuri Kulchytsky – one of prominent figures in Ukrainian and European history – to introduce this tradition in Lviv. He was the one to offer Europeans the then-unknown aromatic beverage back in 1678 by founding a coffee-shop café in Vienna – the first café of such type Europe. There is a café in Lviv that carries the name of Yuri Kulchytsky. After visiting Lviv coffee-cafes you will see that the true art of coffee-cooking thrives in the city.",

        "Description" : "Vinnytsia – (from the Old Slav word gift) is the administrative center of the region, located on the banks of the Pivdennyy Bug River in the eastern part of Podillia of Right-Bank Ukraine. The first mention of the city dates back to the 9th century, when the tribes of the Tivertsy and Uliches settled here. Artifacts of the Scythian and Slavic tribes were also found on the territory of the modern city. Since its foundation, Vinnytsia has acquired a rich historical heritage, which cannot but reflect on the modern appearance and versatility of the city's culture.",
